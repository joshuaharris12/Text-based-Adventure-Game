/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Adventures in London" application. 
 *  The applcation is a text base game and iteracts with the game by typing
 *  commands.
 *  Users are able to walk around areas of London including the Tower of 
 *  London.
 *  
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
